			↑ CRP
			Mild hyperbilirubinemia
			Mild thrombocytopenia
			Chest x-ray: scattered lung infiltrates, abscesses and pleural collections
			CT/MR scan: involvement of the parapharyngeal space and internal jugular vein
			Positive blood culture
			Necrotizing mediastinitis (rare but serious complication)
		Treatment

			If Penicillin allergy -  clindamycin 600 mg x 4 iv
			
	Epiglottitis acuta 		
		Definition	
			A septic abscess infection, primarily localized to the epiglottis. 
			It is almost always caused by H. Influenzae type B. 
			Seen in children between 3-6 years.
		Symptoms	
			Fever
			Affected general condition
			Swallowing pain
			Difficulty breathing
		Objective	
			Strongly red, tense and swollen epiglottis
		Treatment	
			securing free airways and antibiotics with cephalosporin, e.g. cefuroxime.
			
	Pseudocroup  		
		Definition	
			An acute viral mucosal affection with inspiratory stridor due to subglottic oedema. 
			Due to viral infection (most often parainfluenza virus) and is seen in young children aged ½-4 years.
		Symptoms	
			Cough
			Nasal discharge
			Fever
			Accelerated breathing
			Barking cough (sea lion-like)
		Objective	
			Edema of the vocal cords with accompanying hoarseness
			Edema of the larynx just below the vocal cords
			Inspiratory contractions above the clavicle in the jugulum, in the epigastrium and between the costae
			Wheezing, stridor, especially during inspiration
			Cyanosis due to anoxia
			Hypotonia of the musculature due to exhaustion
		Treatment	
			It is important to make the child calm down. 
			The edema usually decreases within a few hours if the child sitting up, preferably in a well-ventilated room with cool air. 
			Cyanosis attacks and stridor are almost always reason for admission. 
			In the worst case, treat with adrenaline inhalations and inhaled steroids. 
			Systemic glucocorticoid is indicated in the most severe cases, and it is only extremely rarely necessary to intubate. Antibiotics are ineffective. The prognosis is good.
			
	Influenza		
		Definition	
			Acute respiratory infection caused by influenza virus belonging to the orthomyxovirus family, as in Denmark circulates every year to a greater or lesser extent from November to March, also called the flu season.
			The genome consists of 8 segments (10 genes) of single-stranded RNA.
			There are 3 human pathogenic influenza viruses based on capsid antigen: Type A, type B and type C
		Symptoms	
			Sudden onset of chills
			Fever up to 39-40 °C
			Severe headache
			Dry cough
			Pain with eye movements
			Dedolations
			Hoarseness
			General muscle pain
		Objective 	
			redness is found in the fauces.
		Paraclinical	
			Neutropenia
			↑ CRP
			Virus in nasal secretion by PCR
		Treatment	
			Neuramidase inhibitor
			Oseltamivir shortens the course of the disease by 1-2 days, if treatment is started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. It is effective against both A and B flu. 75 mg x 2 are given for 5 days.

			Muscle pain
			Sweating
			Fever
			Swallowing pain
			Generalized lymph node tumor
		Objective

			Clinical jaundice (about 5%)
		Paraclinical	
			Leukocytosis with lymphocytosis
			↑ Liver count
			Moderate ↑ or normal bilirubin
			Thrombocytopenia
			Heterophilic antibodies by rapid test (monospot, EMNI test) – 40% in 1st week and 85% in 3rd week
		Treatment	
			The treatment is aciclovir, otherwise symptomatic
